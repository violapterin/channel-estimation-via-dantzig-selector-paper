\Frame {Conclusion}
{
\I We are concerned with effective and estimation of MIMO mm-wave channel by exploiting its sparsity, and studied Dantzig Selector (DS).

\I We modified DS for present setting: for the almost-sparse condition, for the angular domain, for the beamformer matrix \m {\M {P}} in our setting, and for complex vectors.

\I We bound the expected square error and the successful probability, in explicit expression of system parameters such as \m {N_H}, \m {N_Y}, and \m{L}.

\Frame {Future Work}
{
\I Check the proof again, especially the approximation decision.

\I Simulate many different parameters such as \m {N_H}, \m {N_Y}, and \m{L} and discuss extensively.

\I Verify (if correct) the successful-probability bound and observe how \m {N_Y, N_H} affects it (if any).

\I Also implement (some or all of) OMP, LS, LASSO among others, and compare them.
