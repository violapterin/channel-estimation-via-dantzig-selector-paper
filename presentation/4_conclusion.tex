\Frame {Conclusion}
{
\I We estimate MIMO mm-Wave channel \m {\M {H}} by using modifed DS.

\I We justify DS under relaxed sparsity of \m {\V {g}}, and demonstrate the RIP of effective beamformer \m {\M {P}}.

\I We analyze the error norm of DS in terms of \m {N_H}, \m {N_Y}, and \m{L}, and approimate the asymptotic failure probability.

\I By simulation we see that DS can be cast into be a linear program to reduce complexity, and appear to outperform other methods.

\I DS trades off low time and space complexity high precision, and for OMP the opposite is true.
