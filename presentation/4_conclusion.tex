\Frame {Conclusion}
{
\I We estimate MIMO mm-Wave channel \m {\M {H}} by using a modified DS.

\I We justify DS under relaxed sparsity of \m {\V {g}}, and demonstrate the RIP of effective beamformer \m {\M {P}}.

\I We analyze the error norm of DS in terms of \m {N_H}, \m {N_B}, and \m{L}, and approximate the asymptotic failure probability.

\I We suggest several ways of reducing the complexity, and illustrate in simulation that DS often outperforms other methods.

\I We suspect that in cases of higher noise, less sample, or less sparsity, DS is more suitable, so it may be used in combination to other methods.
