\Frame {Conclusion}
{
\I We estimate MIMO mm-Wave channel \m {\M {H}} by using a modified DS.

\I We justify DS in present scenario with almost-sparse \m {\V {g}}, and show the RIP of effective beamformer \m {\M {P}}.

\I We propose a error norm analysis of DS in terms of parameters \m {N_H}, \m {N_Y}, and \m{L}, and investigate the asymptotic successful probability.

\I We convert DS into a linear program of lower complexity, and compare another two-stage version of DS.

\I Experiments show DS does appear superior, at the cost of complexity much greater than OMP
