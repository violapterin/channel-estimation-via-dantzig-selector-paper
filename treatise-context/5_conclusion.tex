The treatise addresses the problem of effective estimation of the millimeter wave channel by exploiting its sparsity.
To do so, we try the Dantzig Selector (DS) for channel estimation, rather than the more commonly used Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).
We exploited the sparsity of spatial frequency domain, and justified the RIP of effective beamformer for the hybrid structure.
We then proved quantitatively that the expected error norm is bounded for overwhelming probability.
DS is cast into an linear program, which help reduce complexity.
Simulation is done, and DS's performance is compared to OMP, Lasso, and LS, and we see that DS indeed outperforms other methods.

DS is more accurate but has higher complexity, so it may be used (possibly in combination of other methods) in the scenario that precision is crucial, and when the observable data is less sufficient.
For example, when the ratio of the antenna and RF chain is larger, or when the application does not allow many stages of estimation, it might be the case that only DS can recover successfully.
