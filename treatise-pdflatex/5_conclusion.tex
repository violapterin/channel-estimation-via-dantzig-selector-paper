The treatise addresses the problem of effective estimation of the millimeter wave channel by exploiting its sparsity.
To do so, we try the Dantzig Selector (DS) for channel estimation, rather than the more commonly used Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).
We exploited the sparsity of spatial frequency domain, and generalized DS for complex vectors.
We then proved quantitatively that the expected error norm is bounded for overwhelming probability.

DS is cast into an linear program, which help reduce complexity.
Simulation is done, and DS's performance is compared to OMP, Lasso, and LS, and we see that DS indeed outperforms other methods.
Despite of its higher complexity, in the low noise scenario, DS can be \m {10} times more accurate, and the gain of spectral efficiency may justify its use.
